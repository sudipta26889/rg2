   * Example: if device name is "Bathroom" and entity name "text", friendly name will be "Bathroom text". If no
   * device, friendly name will be just "text". If a device is set, this name can be left empty if this entity is the
   * one main entity (or only) entity of this device. See

   * information.

   * entity type for the same node ID. Example: If you have a lock for the node ID "door", the home asisstant
   * configuration path will be "homeassistant/binary_sensor/door/lock/config". This works if you only have one lock on
   * your door, but if you have two locks, you want to add a child object ID to them. By setting the child_object_id to
   * say "upper", the configuration will be "homeassistant/binary_sensor/door/lock/upper/config". This also apply for
   * all state/command topics and so on. Leave as empty string for no child object ID. Valid characters
   * are [a-zA-Z0-9_-] (machine readable, not human readable)
   * @param configuration the configuration for this entity.
